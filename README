What is dohthello?
------------------

     dohthello is an Othello(tm?) clone that currently supports a curses
     interface, computer opponents, and network play.

Building dohthello:
------------------

     To compile dohthello, you need to have the freely available ncurses
     library installed. For information on obtaining and installing
     ncurses, please see the URL

          http://www.ccil.org/~esr/ncurses.html

     Once ncurses has been successfully installed, edit the Makefile to
     reflect the correct C compiler, include, and link flags for your
     machine. You might also want to change the default installation
     directories. Type 'make' to compile dohthello, and/or 'make install'
     to copy the dohthello binary and man page to the specified installation
     directory.

     dohthello has been built and tested under SunOS 4.1.4, Solaris 2.5, 
     and Linux 1.2.6.


Playing dohthello:
------------------

     Please see the man page for descriptions of available options. By
     default, dohthello will start with both white and black players local,
     with computer skill level and suggestion skill level set to 2.
     
     If you've ever played Othello(tm?), you're ready to play dohthello. If
     you haven't, hopefully the following synopsis will help you get
     started.

     dohthello is a board game played on an 8x8 board, with two sided
     pieces, once side black, the other white. As play proceeds, pieces
     are added to the board, and pieces already on the board are switched
     from one color to the other.

     The objective of the game is to have the most pieces your color when
     no more moves can be made. Each turn consists of placing one piece
     on the board that "traps" one or more of your opponents pieces 
     between your newly played piece and one of your pieces already in
     place on the board. For example, consider the following board
     configuration, which is the starting configuration for all games:

                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - W B - - -
                             - - - B W - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -

     Assuming it is black's turn, there are 4 possible moves:

                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - 2 - - - -
                             - - 1 W B - - -
                             - - - B W 4 - -
                             - - - - 3 - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -

     If black choose to move the position 2, he would place a piece on
     that position and flip any white pieces between his new piece
     and any existing piece:

                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - B - - - -
                             - - - B B - - -
                             - - - B W - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -
                             - - - - - - - -

     To gain a better understanding of dohthello strategy, you might try
     watching the computer play itself for a few games, with varying
     skill levels, with the command 'dohthello -black computer -white
     computer'.
